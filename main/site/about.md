We are a team of two looking to make cool games!

### Todo list:
- [ ] Finish the website
- [ ] Make a small <s>platformer</s> game
- [x] Hire on (a) new member(s)
- [ ] Some other stuff, I don't know

### Past works
Currently, there are currently no games that we have made as of right now, but there are big things coming up!

### Current Goals
At the moment? Make fun games that have some sembelance of a meaning. The next big game that we have planned is going to be called 'Love and Anxiety'. Is there a current story? Uhm... no. But we're figuring it out, I swear!

### Contact
If you have any questions, email _veritygames@yahoo.com_!
